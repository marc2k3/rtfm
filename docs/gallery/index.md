Not all `Samples` are included here.

See the `Samples` button from the [Configuration Window](../docs/configuration-window.md)
for a complete list. After loading, the right click menu is your friend. Most options should
be self explanatory!

`Samples` that fetch artist info / images from online sources will cache the results indefinitely
inside your [foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org) profile folder \ `js_data`.
