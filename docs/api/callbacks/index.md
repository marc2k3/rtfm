# Overview

!!! note
	You should only use callbacks that contain code
	you want to run.

	It's not good practice to include empty callbacks like this:
	```js
	function on_always_on_top_changed(state) {

	}
	```

Check these pages for callback documentation which has recently been split into separate categories:

[Component](component.md)

[Windows](windows.md)

[foobar2000](foobar2000.md)
