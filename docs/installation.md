## Samples
Since the learning curve for writing your own scripts is quite steep, there
are many included samples that don't require any knowledge at all. You
can simply pick the one you want to use from the `Samples` button in
the [Configuration Window](configuration-window.md).

The [Gallery](gallery/index.md) has recently been updated with more detailed
setup notes / usage instructions.
